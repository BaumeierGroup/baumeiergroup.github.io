# Abstract 

We extend existing lattice models of small-molecule amorphous semiconductors by accounting for changes in molecular polarizability upon charging or excitation. A compact expression of this contribution to the density of states is provided. Although the lattice model and the description based on a microscopic morphology both qualitatively predict an additional broadening, shift, and an exponential tail (traps) of the density of states, a quantitative agreement between the two cannot be achieved.
