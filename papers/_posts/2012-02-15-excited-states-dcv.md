# Abstract 

Excited states of dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophenes are studied using many-body Green’s functions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. By varying the number of oligomer repeat units, we investigate the effects of resonant–antiresonant transition coupling, dynamical screening, and molecular conformations on calculated excitations. We find that the full dynamically screened Bethe-Salpeter equation yields absorption and emission energies in good agreement with experimental data. The effect of resonant–antiresonant coupling on the first singlet π → π* excitation monotonically decreases with increasing size of the molecule, while dynamical screening effects uniformly lower the excitation energies.
