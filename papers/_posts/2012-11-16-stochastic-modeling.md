# Abstract 

We develop a stochastic network model for charge transport simulations in amorphous organic semiconductors, which generalizes the correlated Gaussian disorder model to realistic morphologies, charge transfer rates, and site energies. The network model includes an iterative dominance-competition model for positioning vertices (hopping sites) in space, distance-dependent distributions for the vertex connectivity and electronic coupling elements, and a moving-average procedure for assigning spatially correlated site energies. The field dependence of the hole mobility of the amorphous organic semiconductor, tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, which was calculated using the stochastic network model, showed good quantitative agreement with the prediction based on a microscopic approach.
