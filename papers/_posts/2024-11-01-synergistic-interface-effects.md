# Abstract 

The rapid development of modern energy applications drives an urgent need to enhance the
dielectric strength of energy storage dielectrics for higher power density. Interface design is a
promising strategy to regulate the crucial charge transport process determining dielectric
strength. However, the targeted exploitation of interface effects on charge transport is limited
due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms involving
elementary electronic processes and details of the intricate interplay of characteristics of
molecular building blocks and the interfacial morphology – details that cannot fully be resolved
with experimental methods. Here we employ a multiscale modeling approach linking the
quantum properties of the charge carriers with nano- and mesoscale structural details of
complex interfaces. Applied to a prototypical application-proven cellulose-oil composite with
interfaces formed between oil, disordered, and crystalline cellulose regions, this approach
demonstrates that charges are trapped in the disordered region. Specifically, it unveils this
trapping as a synergistic effect of two transport-regulating interface mechanisms: back-transfer
to the oil region is suppressed by energetic factors, while forward-transfer to the crystalline
cellulose is suppressed by low electronic coupling. The insight into the molecular origins of
interface effects via dual-interface regulation offers new development paths for advanced
energy materials.
