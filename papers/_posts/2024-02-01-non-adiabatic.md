# Abstract 

We investigate the determination of non-adiabatic couplings between localized excitations (LEs) and charge-transfer (CT) excitations based on many-body Green's functions theory in the GW approximation with the Bethe--Salpeter equation (GW-BSE). Using a small molecule dimer system, we first study the influence of different diabatization methods, as well as different model choices within GW-BSE, such as the self-energy models or different levels of self-consistency, and find that these choices affect the LE-CT couplings only minimally. We then consider a large-scale low-donor morphology formed from rubrene and fullerene and evaluate the LE-CT couplings based on coupled GW-BSE-molecular mechanics calculations. For these disordered systems of bulky molecules, we observe differences in the couplings based on the Edmiston--Ruedenberg compared to the more approximate Generalize Mulliken--Hush and Fragment Charge Difference diabatization formalisms. In a kinetic model for the conversion between LE and CT states, these differences affect the details of state populations in an intermediate timescale but not the final populations.
