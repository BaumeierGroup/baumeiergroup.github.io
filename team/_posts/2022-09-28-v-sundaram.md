I was born and completed all my prior education in India. I have done my B.Tech (2017) and M.Tech (2018) in a joint dual-degree program in the discipline of Materials Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I joined TU Eindhoven as a Ph.D. in August 2018.

My project focuses on the study of excitation dynamics with the use and development of multi-scale simulation techniques for materials posed as probable candidates for next generation solar cells. The projects I have worked on in the past include Study of the effect of octahedral ordering on the thermoelectric properties of double perovskites using DFT (Masterâ€™s thesis) and Impedance characterization of high entropy oxides for solid-sate batteries (B.Tech project).
