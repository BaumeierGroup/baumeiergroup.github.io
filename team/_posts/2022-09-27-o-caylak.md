thesis: Electronic Structure Calculations and Machine Learning - from Theory to Multiscale Applications
---

I pursued my initial academic interests at VU University Amsterdam, where I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2015. Under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Andre Ran.

Moving to Eindhoven for further studies, I enrolled in a Master's program in Industrial and Applied Mathematics. In 2017, as a part of the master's programm, I wrote a thesis supervised by Dr. Georg Prokert.

Later in 2017, I initiated his doctoral research, sponsored by the NWO, at the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Applications in Eindhoven. Under the guidance and support of Dr. Bjoern Baumeier. My current research primarily revolves around integrating machine learning techniques into electronic structure calculations.
